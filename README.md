Pattern-Matcher-N-Replacer
==========================

I have made this program to replace some specific words with some particular line of codes. Actually My project manager had assigned me the work of localizing the full project. So for that I need to replace the text messages with some code lines in the whole project, so if I were do it manually , then it would take almost 3-4 months of me to complete it. So I made this program which finds those text messages written inside the code and replace them with some code line and a key and this program also make an entry of that key-value  pair inside messages.properties file, thus in this way I have saved about 2000 man hours of my company
